# Exploring NYC High School Data

Welcome to the "Exploring NYC High School Data" project! This repository contains code and analysis focused on investigating the relationships between various factors and SAT scores in New York City high schools.

## Project Overview

In this project, we analyze publicly available data from NYC high schools to uncover potential correlations between different factors and SAT scores. The dataset includes information about demographics, safety perceptions, AP exam participation, and more. By exploring these relationships, we aim to gain insights into the factors that might influence students' performance on the SAT.

## Files and Directories

- `schools/`: Directory containing CSV files with school-related data.
- `schools/survey_all.txt` and `schools/survey_d75.txt`: Survey data related to schools.
- `exploration.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Analysis Highlights

Here are some of the key analysis points covered in the project:

- Correlations: Investigating correlations between various factors and SAT scores.
- Safety and SAT Scores: Exploring the relationship between safety perceptions and SAT scores.
- Borough Safety: Comparing safety perceptions across different NYC boroughs.
- Racial Differences: Examining the impact of racial demographics on SAT scores.
- Gender Differences: Investigating the influence of gender demographics on SAT scores.
- AP Exam Scores: Analyzing the connection between AP exam participation and SAT scores.

## Findings and Conclusion

Through our analysis, we discovered the following insights:

- Students who are more likely to complete surveys tend to perform well academically.
- Safety perceptions are positively correlated with SAT scores, highlighting the importance of a secure learning environment.
- There are racial disparities in SAT scores, with white and Asian students generally performing better than black and Hispanic students.
- Schools with higher percentages of female students tend to have better SAT scores.
- A relationship exists between AP exam participation and SAT scores, suggesting a positive impact on academic performance.
